<H1>Hello Coursera! It's a great day to be in tha cave!</H1>
<p>
So there goes... Not my first attempt to learn to code.<br>
 The other ones never got of the ramp. Lets see if I can <br>
 do better this time<br>
I will begin this jorney with :
<ul>
    <li>Html</li>
  <li>css</li>
  <li>javascript</li>
 </ul>
  Then we'll see. I need to be able to write on my<br> book as well.
